About PC Matic
--------------

PC Matic is a cloud-based antivirus and system optimization tool designed to keep your computer safe and efficient. Unlike traditional antivirus programs that use blacklists, PC Matic uses a **whitelist-based approach**, allowing only trusted applications to run. This greatly reduces the risk of malware infections.

Key features include:

Logging into your account is the first step to accessing these features.

Login Steps

Follow these steps to securely log into your PC Matic account:

**Step 1: Open Your Browser**

Use any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Ensure your browser is updated for compatibility and security.

**Step 2: Visit the Official Website**

Navigate to the official PC Matic website. Double-check the URL to avoid phishing attempts or fake login pages.

**Step 3: Click the Login Button**

On the homepage, locate and click the **Login** button, typically found in the top-right corner.

**Step 4: Enter Your Credentials**

Input your registered **email address** and **password**. Double-check for typos, especially in your password, which is case-sensitive. Avoid using the "Remember me" option on shared or public devices.

**Step 5: Access Your Dashboard**

Click **Sign In**. If your credentials are correct, you’ll be directed to your account dashboard, where you can manage settings, run scans, and view reports.

Troubleshooting Login Issues
----------------------------

If you encounter problems during login, consider the following solutions:

**Forgot Password**

- Click the **Forgot Password** link on the login page.
- Enter your email address and follow the instructions in the reset email.
- Choose a strong password with letters, numbers, and symbols.

**Incorrect Email**

- Make sure you’re using the email address linked to your PC Matic purchase or registration.
- Search your inbox for emails from PC Matic to verify the correct address.

**Account Lockout**

Security and Convenience Tips

To make your login process secure and hassle-free, follow these best practices:

**Use a Password Manager**

A password manager stores and auto-fills your credentials securely, reducing the chance of typos or forgotten passwords.

If available, enable 2FA. After entering your password, you'll receive a verification code via email or phone for an added layer of security.

Never share your credentials. Even with trusted individuals, this increases your risk of unauthorized access.

Update your password periodically and avoid reusing it across services.
